# Guidelines for Claude

- Always ensure files have a newline at end of file (EOF)
- Always run linter before committing code changes
  - Check .github/workflows/lint.yml for current linting rules (currently using golangci-lint)
  - Review other workflow files in .github/workflows/ for potential additional validation rules
